# chess_position_finder

Imports a chess pgn file and analyses it with the [stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) chess engine. Outputs a list of chess positions for the user to try to solve for themselves. 

TODO:
Make the app work with flask correctly so we can take screenshots to have a nicer readme :)
